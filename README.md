# Project 3: Spots

### Description

This project is called Spots and Spots is a sleek photo sharing app that is appropriate for users on a wide range of devices. The warm colors give this project a welcoming experience for users. This is the third website that I have created and by far the most intrique code that I've written. I look forward to refactoring this in the future to implement new skills that I learn, as well as getting feedback for improvements.

**Project Technology**

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS for design implemting BEM methodology
- I used implementation of button creations, flexbox and grid displays.
- The responsive aspect was created with the help of flexbox and media quieries. So this design is appropriate for most screen sizes ranging from desktop to mobile viewing.

**Tools**

- Figma - This was the first time I used Figma for reading the design work. It was easy to use and reference for exact measurements and requirements for the project. I am excited to learn more about working with Figma in the future.

- VS CODE - VS Code was used to create the HTML and CSS codes. :) in this project I was able to get more accustomed to using this software.

**Refactoring Plans**

- Instead of placeing the images for the buttons in the HTML I will place them in CSS
- Create a "sticky footer"
- Implementing proper SEO friendly Alt text to each image
